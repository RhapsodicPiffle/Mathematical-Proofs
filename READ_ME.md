This document was created during my undergrad math classes. I had a freshmen level math class that tasked me with documenting new and interesting things we learned. At the same time, I was learning Latex. So I decided to put them together. I continued this activity throughout the rest of my math classes. Clearly I didn't finish all of the proofs, but I'm sitll glad I have what I have. Maybe one day I'll go back and update this.
